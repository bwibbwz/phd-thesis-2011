\item Perhaps use the Newton/Schr\"odinger figure I made a bit back (modified if needed)
\item General on atomistic simulations (seguing to potential functions and DFT)
\item Why statistical methods
\item Why path techniques (introduction to be expanded on in the TST section)
\item It is now "possible" to do long timescale MD simlations but statistical methods are still more suited to find "all" the processes (chat with Elvar on MD)
\item (Why these methods but not some other?)
