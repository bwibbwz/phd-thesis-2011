\subsection{The Hessian Matrix}
The Hessian matrix contains the second derivatives of a given function.
Its dimensions are $N\times N$, where $N$ is the amount of degrees of freedom of the function.
In the context of atomic simulations N is generally 3 time the number of atoms in the system, as each one has 3 indepentand degrees of freedom.
