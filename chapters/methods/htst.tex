To actually calculate the partition functions can be a tedious task and finding a good transition state is a non-trivial one, if possible.
Fortunately, for many systems (e.g. solid state materials), the transition state can be approximated and the configation integrals simplified.

Between any two basins there exists a \sap{1}, which represents the lowest possible potential energy that the system must overcome in order for a tranistion to occur.
Exploiting this, the $\ts$ can a chosen as a hyperplane in which the \sap{1} resides and whose normal is the eigenmode that corresponds with the lowest eigenvalue of the Hessian.
This greatly simplifies the definition of the $\ts$.
Furthermore, in order to simplify the calculation of the partition functions, the PES near both $\ts$, $E_\ts$, and R, $E_\text{R}$, are represented by second degree Taylor expansions,
\beq{htst-taylor-expansion}
E_\ts \approx E_\text{\sap{1}} 
\eeq

\subsubsection{Terminology ("Transition State" vs. "Saddle Point")}
Due to the popularity of the harmonic approximation to TST, a common misconception is that saddle points and transition states are interchangeable terms.
This is apparent in the literature, even where HTST is directly discussed or saddle points and reaction paths found.
\tblue{No need to "name and shame"?}

The confusion stems from the fact that the saddle point is the only geometrical feature needed to construct the transition state.
Once found, the saddle point acts as the ... \tblue{Write after the actual definition of HTST has been written out.}

Even though the distinction is not overly important within HTST, it is of central importance in TST, as the actual definition of the transition state is vital.
