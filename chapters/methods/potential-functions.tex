\item Introduce pairwise potentials
\item Why / When they are preferred to QM calculations
\item Quickly discuss EAM/EMT

Extensive use was made of potential functions in this thesis.
Simple and quick test cases served to produce PESes that could be visualised in two dimensions, while still retaining the properties of truly multidimensional systems.
And for production calculations (\fref{sec:al-self-diffusion}).
