Transition State Theory (TST) is a formalism dedicated to providing reaction rates in a purely theoretical setting where running dynamical trajectories of the required length is infeasible.

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsubsection{The Time-scale Problem}

\figmiss{Timescale problem (I have one somewhere, just need to polish it and stick it in)}

In atomistic simulations there is a often a clear separation of timescales between the most interesting events.
With local vibration of the atoms being very fast, typically on the order of $10^{14} \unit{Hz}$~\citemiss,
while non-local reordering of atoms, motion between minima on the PES, often considered as rare-events, typically occur on the order of $10^3 \unit{Hz}$ for a system with an energy barrier of $0.5 \unit{eV}$.~\citemiss
Depending on the temperature of the system, a tremendous amount of calculations (on the order of $10^10$) would have to be performed to have a reasonable probability of seeing each rare-event while also fully modelling the details of the atomic vibrations.

Even though performing dynamics long enough to accurately describe both types of events, is technically possible~\citemiss, e.g. by minimising vibrations to allow for longer timesteps~\citemiss or modifying the PES~\cite{hyperdynamics-voter-1997}, the key to long-timescale dynamics still lies outside the reach of such methods as they spend most of their time performing dynamics that are not of particular interest for molecular dynamics.
This is true, in particular, for calculations that rely on costly, but accurate, quantum calculations and/or large systems.

In the problem lies also the solution, when there is such a clear separation of time-scales, it is possible to treat the problem with statistical methods.
Essentially dealing with the vibrational areas of the PES (the basins) by averaging over them and seperately locating ares of transitions.

\subsubsection{The Transition State}

\figmiss{Transition State}

When dividing the phase space (position and momentum) into two areas, reactants (R) and products (P), a hypersurface separating the two emerges.
This hypersurface is referred to as the transition state ($\ts$)\footnote{The dagger, $\ts$, is a conventional symbol for the transition state} and represents a bottleneck region which each reactive trajectory crosses on its way from R to P.
Commonly, momentum is disregarded in the definition of the phase space, which is then  $3N$ dimensional, within which the $\ts$ is a $3N-1$ dimensional subspace.

\item Configuration Integrals (or partition functions?)

Take advantage of the time-scale separation ...

TST aims at overcoming the time-scale problem by way of "averaging" over the fast vibrational motion to present a reaction rate for the rare-events.

Boltzmann distribution...
Maxwell distribution (velocity)...

%The partition functions require the total energy of the $N$ atoms system,
%\beq{tst-total-energy}
%E(\vR, \vect{v}) = V(\vR) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_i^{N} m_i \left| \vect{v}_i \right|^2
%\eeq
%with atoms at $\vR$ with velocity $\vect{v}$, travelling on the PES, $V$.

\incomplete

The most important assumption remains, any trajectories that cross the TS do not recross it.
This assumtion is also the weakest link \expand

\subsection{Reaction Rates}
The reaction rate, $k^\text{TST}$, is defined as the probability of being at the $\ts$,
%$P_\ts = \langle \delta(\vR - \vR_\ts) \rangle_\text{R}$,
\beq{ts-probability-partition-simple}
P_\ts = \frac{Z_\ts}{Z_\text{R}},
\eeq
thermally averaged over R, with velocity away from R,\citemiss
\beq{tst-rate-initial}
k^\text{TST} = \frac{1}{2}|\vect{v}_\perp| P_\ts,
\eeq
where $\vect{v}_\perp$ is the velocity component perpendicular to the $\ts$ and the factor $1/2$ comes from the fact that only half of the trajectories will be moving away from R.
Due to the different dimensionality of the $\ts$ and R, $P_\ts$ isn't strictly a probability as it has the unit $\unit{m^{-1}}$. \expand

The velocity at each point $\vR$ can be taken from a Maxwell distribution, \tred{(Why is this okay?)}
\beq{tst-maxwell-velocity}
\langle |\vect{v}| \rangle = \sqrt{\frac{2kT}{\pi m}},
\eeq
where $m$ is the mass of the particles \tred{(This is wrong)}.
The rate then becomes
\beq{tst-rate-full}
k_\text{TST} = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{2\pi m}} \frac{Z_\ts}{Z_\text{R}}. \quad \text{\expand}
\eeq
