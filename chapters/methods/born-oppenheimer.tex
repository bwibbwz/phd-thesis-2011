\subsection{The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation}
\label{sec:born-oppenheimer}

In order to simplify calculation of large atomic systems, the difference in weight of the electrons and the nuclei is exploited by performing tha calculations in two steps.
First the electronic wavefunction is determined while the nuclei are kept fixed followed by a calculation for the motion of the nuclei while the electronic wavefunction is kept fixed.
