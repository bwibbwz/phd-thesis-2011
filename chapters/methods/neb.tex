\subsection{Nudged Elastic Band}
\label{sec:neb}

Finding Steepest Decent Paths (SDPs) from a given point is simple by following the gradient with a small step size.
On the other hand, finding specific SDPs that end at minima is not.
The goal here is to find two SDPs each leading from the same \sap1 to different minima without any further information than the minima.
