The calculational supercell was relaxed, from the  $fddd$ spacegroup ($\#70$), totalling 176 atoms.

The structure consists of 5 symmetry inequivelant \ce{BH4} sites.
For each one a PES was constructed

\figmiss{Environment, for explaining the axes used}

Each \ce{BH4} unit is wedged between, or close to an axis at a distance of $L$, the two nearest neighbour magnesium atoms. \expand

\subsubsection{Rotation of \ce{BH4-}}
The experimental data suggested only rotational dynamics present at the relevant temperatures.
Thus, the work exclusively revolved around understanding which rotations correpsonded with the experiments.

For each symmetry inequivelant \ce{BH4} unit, a contourplot was constructed in order to get an overview of the possible rotations.
Since the rotational system has three dimensions but the contourplot has only two, the axes had to be chosen carefully as to sample all interesting events for each site.


Choosing the $C_2$ axis essentially consisted of

It is unsurprising to find that there is a direct relationship between $L$, the distance from the \ce{Mg}-\ce{Mg} axis to \ce{B}, and the $C_2$ barrier height.
In fact, the relationship is linear, as can be seen in %\fref{fig:mg-barriers}.
On the other hand, no such direct relationship could be found for the $C_3$ axes.
