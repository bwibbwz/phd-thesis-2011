\item Calculate rigid rotations of \ce{BH4-} to get a "feel" for the landscape for all the different borons in the cell
\item Show multiple PESes
\item Then calculate the reaction paths (MEPs) and saddle points
\item Prepare HTST rates and compare with experiments
\item Revise the experimental rates as applicable
