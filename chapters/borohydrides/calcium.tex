\item Calculate rigid rotations of \ce{BH4-} to get a "feel" for the landscape
\item Then calculate the reaction paths (MEPs) and saddle points
\item Prepare HTST rates and compare with experiments
\item Revise the experimental rates as applicable
\item Do further MEP calculations for mechanisms that still remain unexplained in the experimental data

The calculational parameters can be found in Paper \ref{pap:calcium}.

The experimental work was performed in order to detect rotational diffusion of hydrogen and the initial data agreed with what was set out.
Thus, at first, only rotations around the possible symmetry axes, $C_2$ and $C_3$ of the \ce{BH4-} unit were considered.
Contour plots of the rigid rotation can be produced in order to get an overview of the possible rotations, pure or coupled, and their relative barrier heights.
\figmiss{All the PESes. Perhaps there is only one for \ce{Ca(BH4)2}?}

The contour plots give an important insight as to which of the possible rotations are the interesting ones.
Furthermore, due to slight breaking of the symmetry certain rotations will have different barriers \expand

\Fref{fig:ca-pes01} shows that a $C_3$ axis will be low in energy and that a wobbly $C_2$ axis with a small intermediate minimum is second lowest.
Using these as the starting paths for NEB calculations we find that \expand
