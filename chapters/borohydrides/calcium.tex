\ben
\item Calculate rigid rotations of \ce{BH4-} to get a "feel" for the landscape
\item Then calculate the reaction paths (MEPs) and saddle points
\item Prepare HTST rates and compare with experiments
\item Revise the experimental rates as applicable
\item Do further MEP calculations for mechanisms that still remain unexplained in the experimental data
