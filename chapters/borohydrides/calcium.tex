The experimental data suggested three separate processes, two of which were assigned to rotational diffusion of hydrogen, while the latter was assigned to longer range diffusion of hydrogen.

\subsubsection{Rotation of \ce{BH4-}}
The bulk of the initial data from the QENS experiments indicated rotational diffusion of hydrogen, while possible high temperature long-range diffusion was also detected.
Thus, at first, only rotations around the possible symmetry axes, $C_2$ and $C_3$, of the \ce{BH4-} unit were considered.
By choosing the appropriate axes, contour plots of the rigid rotation were produced in order to get an overview of the possible rotations, pure or coupled, and an estimate of their relative barrier heights.

\figmiss{All the PESes. Perhaps there is only one for \ce{Ca(BH4)2}?}

Since the rotational system has three dimensions but the contourplot has only two, the axes had to be chosen very carefully as to avoid missing an important event.
The $C_2$ axis was chosen as to maximise the hydrogen-calcium distance.
The choice of $C_3$ axis is less critical \expand

The contour plots give an important insight as to which of the possible rotations are the interesting ones and, thus, calculating the more resource intensive MEPs can be limited to the interesting processes.

Some symmetry breaking can be seen in the PESes.
This is to be expected as the tetragonal symmetry can be slightly broken during the minimisation.

\Fref{fig:ca-pes01} shows that a $C_3$ axis is lowest in energy and that a wobbly $C_2$ axis with a small intermediate minimum is the lowest energy $C_2$ type rotation.
Using these as the starting paths for NEB calculations, the MEPs shown overlayed in \fref{fig:ca-pes01} are found and shown as energy profiles in \fref{fig:ca-barriers}.

The calculations complement the experimental data very well, both with regards to the barrier height as well as the charactristic times which are derived from the HTST reaction rates. (see Table 2 in Paper \ref{pap:calcium})

\subsubsection{Long-range diffusion \pending}

\item Theory suggests not pure hydrogen, thus, probably solvent

The long range diffusion was based on only two data points.
