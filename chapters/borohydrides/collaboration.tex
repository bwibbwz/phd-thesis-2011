\section{Collaboration Between Theoretical and Experimental Work}
\label{sec:cooperation}

This project was built on tight collaboration bewteen experimental and theoretical work.
\bit
\item Idea for investigating certain types of dynamics is born
\item Do the experiments at the appropriate instrument(s)
\item Initial analysis gives good indication as to what type of dynamics have been observed
\item Quickly explain the experimental models used (Chutley-Elliot)
\item Theoretical calculations take these indications and expand on them
\item Theory suggests rates for specific events
\item Experimental calculations are revised (e.g. Different fitting parameters)
\item Any unexplained events get investigated specifically by theory

\section{Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering?}
\label{sec:qens}
\bit
\item A super quick introduction to QENS
\item Excellent for analysing hydrogen motion (large incoherent (?) cross-section)
\item Example curves
