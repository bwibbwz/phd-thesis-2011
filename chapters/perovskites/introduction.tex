\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:perovskites-introduction}

As a DFT test case for the ridge detection method, a system that was the subject of a recent Ph.D. thesis~\cite{nicolai-2010} in Tejs Vegge's group was chosen due to familiarity.
The coupled hydrogen defect in a \ce{SrTiO3} perovskite structure.~\cite{double-defect-2011}
Usage of such systems can be varied, \expand
However, in the context of this thesis it was chosen as a real world example with noisy forces to briefly test the ridge detection method.

%It is of particular interest to see if the diffusional process is coupled.
%This had been shown in \cite{double-defect-2011} \expand

Due to time constrictions this chapter can only briefly touch on the subject of ridge calculations with noisy (DFT) forces.
Neither could the study be comprehensive nor detailed.
Much rather, a series of problems were encountered and analysed within a very short period of time.
