\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:perovskites-introduction}

This chapter describes work performed to further understand the coupled hydrogen defects in perovskites.
The original work was based on ... cite

\item Stabilisation confirmed via dimer calculations
\item Ridge calculations performed and their results are ...
\item Ridge calculations performance on a production DFT system
\item Hard to say if medium range stabilisation takes place (outlook: do similiar calculations using larger cells)
