A ridge is a colloection of steepest decent paths (SDPs) between any \sap2s and \sap1s between two end \sap1s.

We shall first introduce the finding of ridges for any given function of multiple variables before taking the specific example of potential energy surfaces (PESes) and atomic simulations and,
finally, investigating the quality of HTST in \tblue{2 systems}:
The diffusion of Al on an Al(100) surface and \tblue{hydrogen diffusion in perovskites}.
