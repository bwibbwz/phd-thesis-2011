\section{Ridge Mapping}
\label{sec:ridge-mapping}

Given a function, $E$, of multiple varibles, $\vR$, its gradient, $\nabla E(\vR)$, and two \sap{1}s, the goal is to identify a path that lies close to the ridge between the two \sap{1}s.
The path should, in particular, lie through any intermediate \sap{2}s so that a comparison of the height of \sap{2}s with respect to the \sap{1}s can be made.
The method should, furthermore, lead to the identification of previously unknown \sap{1}(s) on the ridge in between the given end points, should they exist.

\subsubsection{Gradient Modification}
Similarly to the NEB method~\cite{neb-original-1998} (\fref{sec:neb}), a path of $N$ images, $[\vR_0, \vR_1, \ldots, \vR_N]$, is iteratively aligned with the ridge by modifying the gradient or force, $\vF_i \equiv -\nabla E(\vR_i)$.
Unlike the NEB method, further force modifications are needed, in order to let the ridge appear as a MEP.

The path is at each image defined by its tangent, $\uvt_i$, and in order for the path to be at a SDP (such as the ridge), any force components perpendicular to it,
\beq{perpendicular-force}
\vF_i^\perp \equiv \vF_i -(\vF_i \cdot \uvt_i)\uvt_i,
\eeq
must be zero,
\beq{ridge-force}
\vF^\perp_\text{ridge} = \vect{0}.
\eeq
Furthermore, one negative eigenvalue of the Hessian, perpendicular to the path, must be guaranteed.\footnote{If finding higher order ridges is desired, more negative eigenvalues must be guaranteed.}
The Dimer methodology~\cite{dimer-original-1999, dimer-olsen-2004} (\fref{sec:dimer}) for finding the lowest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector (minimum mode) of the Hessian, $\uvn_i$, can produce a transformed force,
\beq{transformed-force}
\vF_i^\text{t} = \vF_i^\perp - 2(\vF_i^\perp \cdot \uvn_i)\uvn_i,
\eeq
that will let ridges appear, locally as MEPs.
Since eigenvectors are not neccesarily perpendicular to the ridge (as can be seen in figure 1 of paper \ref{pap:second-order}), the path itself must be left out of the Hessian's vector space, thus applying an orthogonality constraint on the minimum mode,
\beq{orthogonality-contrainst}
\uvt_i \cdot \uvn_i = 0,
\eeq
at all times.

\subsubsection{Numerical Instabilities}
\bit
\item The orthgonality constraint, introduced in \fref{eq:orthogonality-constraint}, has the possibility to introduce numerical instabilities.
\item Simply using the dimer introduces instabilities.
\item Odd starting profiles (monotonic or inverted barriers) are dangerous.

\subsection{Energy Ridge Mapping}
\label{sec:energy-ridge-mapping}

In the context of atomic simulations, the function in question is often the potential energy as a function of all atomic co-ordinates.
