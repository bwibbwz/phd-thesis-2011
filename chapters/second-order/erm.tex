\section{Ridge Mapping}
The goal is to define a path which can be iteratively optimized to align itself with a specific steepest decent path (SDP),
starting at a \sap2 and ending at a \sap1.
To accomplish this a path between neighboring \sap1s is defined,
which once converged will lead from one \sap1 along an SDP,
through a \sap2,
continuing along an SDP to, finally, arrive at the latter \sap1.
The path represents two SDPs, from the \sap2 to each \sap1 respectively.

For a function $V$ of multiple variables, $\vR$, a ridge is a collection of points where the gradient, $\vF \equiv -\nabla V(\vR)$, prependicular to the path, defined by its tangent, $\uvt$,
\beq{perpendicular-gradient}
\vF^\perp \equiv \vF - (\vF \cdot \uvt)\uvt,
\eeq
vanishes,
\beq{vanishing-gradient}
\vF^\perp_\text{@ridge} = \vect{0}.
\eeq
To distinguish ridges from other SDPs,
a condition for the Hessian must be set,
exactly one negative eigenvalue, $\lambda^\text{min}$, must be present in a reduced Hessian, for the subspace excluding the path's tangent,
corresponding to an eigenvector, $\uvm$, that is perpendicular to the path,
\beq{ridge-hessian-criteria}
\uvm \cdot \uvt = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda^\text{min} < 0.
\eeq
The reduced Hessian must be used in this case as near \sap2s there are 2 negative eigenvalues for the full Hessian, one of which is not perpendicular to the path.
Furthermore, as can be seen in \fref{fig:eigenmodes}, there can be regions where the eigenvectors do not align themselves with the path at all,
however, when considering the reduced Hessian, all eigenmodes are perpendicular to the path.

If the force parallel to the path is not considered it is possible ...
It is possible to, locally, transform the force to ...

\subsection{Energy Ridge Mapping}
In the context of atomic simulations, the function in question is often the potential energy as a function of all atomic co-ordinates.
