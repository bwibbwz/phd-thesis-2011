\section{Energy Ridge Mapping}
The goal is to define a path which can be iteratively optimized to align itself with a specific steepest decent path,
starting at a \sap2 and ending at a \sap1.
To accomplish this a path between neighboring \sap1s is defined,
which once converged will lead from one \sap1 along a ridge,
through a \sap2,
continuing along the ridge to, finally, arrive at the latter \sap1.
