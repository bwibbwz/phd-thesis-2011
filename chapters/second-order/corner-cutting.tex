\section{Minimising Corner Cutting \pending}
\label{sec:erm-corner-cutting}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

Should finding the exact ridge be the goal, multiple strategies can be envisioned all of which aim at somehow reducing the perpendicular component of the spring force while avoiding and/or minimising the instabilities discussed above.

\bit
\item Iteratively remove parts of $\vF^\text{S}_\perp$ and relax
\item Detect corner cutting ($\hat{\vF^\text{t}_\perp} \cdot \hat{\vF^\text{S}}_\perp \approx -1$ and $|\vF^\text{t}_\perp| \approx |\vF^\text{S}_\perp|$). Maybe detect a cone around the corner cutting direction and reduce containment there for the next steps also.
\eit
I've tried both with moderate to good success rate on the hop diffusion of Al (EMT).
Need to move on to more complicated systems (concerted self-diffusion of Al).

--- Minor fluctuations in the tangent ... 

A possible "solution" is to keep the dimer fixed after switching to the "reduce corner-cutting phase" but then the dimer WILL be wrong after a few iteration in the last phase.
Maybe the answer is to take an average of previous tangents, etc.

Since there is no guarantee that the eigenmodes align with the tangent and minimum mode at all points on the ridge (see \fref{fig:modes}), it is not advisable to let go of the orthogonality constraint bewteen the minumum mode and the tangent,
\beq{orthogonality-constraint}
\uvn \cdot \uvt = 0.
\eeq
Early tests of releasing the constraint on some of the images were not reliable.
