\chapter{First Order Saddle Point Methods}
\label{chap:saddle-point-methods}

Finding \sap{}s is a non-trivial task in multiple dimensions, when only local information is available and computational resources are limited, such that calculation of the Hessian matrix is infeasible.
Nevertheless, multiple methods exist for finding \sap{1}s and can, generally, be divided into two distinct categories.
\ben{sap-method-catergories}
\item General methods which can locate a nearby \sap{1}, requiring only a point with a non-zero gradient as input.
\item More specific methods that require two minima as input to find the MEP and a \sap{1} (\sap{1}s) between them.
\een
The latter category is well suited for use within computational chemistry and such methods have been succesfully used therewithin to describe reaction pathsi between two stable structures.\citemiss
The first category is more useful when there is direction of more interest than others.
