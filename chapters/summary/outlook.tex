\item How ridge calculations interact with different types of saddle points (such as those with $H = \vect{0}$, SPs which are also points of inflection or turning points)
\item Use ridges to create full transition states with the dimer as normal to a hyperplanar segment
\item Catalytic Selectivity
\item Extend to Quantum HTST
