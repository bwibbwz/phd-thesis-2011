The rotational dynamics of two complex borohydrides were investigated in detail with close collaboration to experimental work.

A method for detecting energy ridges (easily applicable to any multidimensional function) was developed.
By combining the dimer algorithm for mapping convex regions to concave regions, i.c. first order saddle points to minima and ridges to minimum energy paths, and the nudged elastic band algorithm for finding minimum energy paths


\bit
\item Mapping ridge paths is achieved using a novel way of combining previously well established \sap{1} algorithms.
\item \expand
\item Initial attempts at DFT ridges were promising when the initial guesses were good enough but minima trapping was an unexplained problem
