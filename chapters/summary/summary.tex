The rotational dynamics of two complex borohydrides were investigated in detail with close collaboration to experimental work.

\tred{This is all pretty much shit.}
By combining the dimer algorithm for mapping convex subspaces to concave ones, i.c. first order saddle points to minima and ridges to minimum energy paths, and the nudged elastic band algorithm for finding minimum energy paths, a method for detecting energy ridges (easily applicable to any multidimensional function) was developed.
Using the energy ridges found near the self-diffusional saddle points of an \ce{Al}(100) adatom, improvements to the reaction rate \expand

\item Mapping ridge paths is achieved using a novel way of combining previously well established \sap{1} algorithms.
\item \expand
\item Initial attempts at DFT ridges were promising when the initial guesses were good enough but minima trapping was an unexplained problem
