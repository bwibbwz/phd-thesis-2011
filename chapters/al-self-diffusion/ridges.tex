\section{Energy Ridges}
\label{al-energy-ridges}

The energy ridges between all the lowest energy \sap{1}s were calculated.
Two situations of particular interest arose.
The first was the discovery of intermediate \sap{1}s, while the second concerned the HTST reaction rate, its accuracy and efforts to improve it.

\subsubsection{Intermediate \sap{1}s}
\begin{figure}[hp]

\caption{
Calculated path at the ridge between the \sap{1}s for a hop and concerted 4-atom displacement.
The circles show the position of converged images (coloured circles for \sap{1}s and \sap{2}s, but grey for the rest). 
These \sap{1}s turned out not to be adjacent on a ridge and the path optimisation reveals an intermediate \sap{1}, the one for the concerted 2-atom displacement.
%This illustrates how a ridge calculation could reveal new and possibly unknown transition mechanisms.
The long path is not able to accurately locate the intermediate \sap{1} and the lower energy \sap{2} due to finite resolution in the discretisation and corner-cutting.
The exact configuration of the \sap{1} can be found using a \sap{1} finding algorithm starting with the approximation obtained from the optimised path.
Then, a calculation of a shorter path, between the \sap{1}s of the 2-atom  and 4-atom displacements, locates the intermediate \sap{2} accurately (cyan circle)
The insets show an overlay of three configurations, two adjacent \sap{1}s and the intermediate \sap{2}.
The atom colours correspond to the coloured spheres of the energy ridge.

As can be seen in \fref{fig:discovery} there is a significant energy ridge "barrier" separating the hop and concerted 2 atom \sap{1}s.
More interestingly, ridge calculations between the more populous concerted \sap{1}s (3 and 4 atom) and the hop revealed that they were interspersed with the concerted 2 atom \sap{1}.
This is not surprising as the concerted mechanisms are all quite similar with regards to their coordinates, while the hop mechanism is inherently different.

Finding the intermediate \sap{1} is only accurate in the limit of an infinite amount of images and no corner cutting, but the lowest energy image gives a good starting guess, both for the coordinates and the minimum mode, for traditional \sap{1} methods, such as the Dimer.
It would be possible to implement a "sinking" image alteration of the effective force in a manner similar to the climbing image but this was not done here.
Similarly, corner cutting prevents rigorous convergence to the lower energy \sap{2}.
A second climbing image would converge exactly to this point but this was not done.\footnote{Implementing multiple climbing or sinking images is in principle not difficult but the ramifications could be dire, e.g. in systems with rugged landscapes and a limited amount of images.}
However, performing a second ridge calculation with the intermediate \sap{1}(s) as end points yields the exact \sap{1} and, apart from the possible corner cutting, the ridge.
These latter paths are displayed as red curves in \fref{fig:discovery}

\subsubsection{Beyond Harmonicity}
\begin{figure}[hp]

The circles represent the position of images in the optimised paths, the \sap{1}s and the \sap{2}s being coloured differently but the rest coloured grey.
The green curves represent harmonic approximations to the energy surface at each \sap{1}.
The insets show an overlay of three configurations, two adjacent \sap{1}s and the intermediate \sap{2}.

\begin{figure}[hb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = 0.5\linewidth]{integral-ratios}
\caption{
The harmonic correction ratio, $\Gamma$, defined in \fref{eq:htst-correction-factor},
between the configuration integrals of the potential energy ridge shown in \fref{fig:low-barriers} and the corresponding harmonic approximations.
The lines represent the ratio for individual processes: concerted 2 atom (blue, dotted), 3 atom (green, dashed), 4 atom (red, dash-dotted) and the ratio for all the processes combined (black, solid).
%The black, solid, line is the ratio for the full integral, including all three concerted displacement processes.
%The blue, dotted, line is the ratio when only considering the 2-atom concerted displacement.
%The green, dashed, line is the ratio when only considering the 3-atom concerted displacement.
%The red, dash-dotted, line is the ratio when only considering the 4-atom concerted displacement.
For the individual processes, the end points of the ridge integral are the adjacent \sap{2}s, while the full integral is done for the whole ridge.
%While the harmonic approximation gives a good approximation for the total configuration integral over the whole temperature range shown, because it is dominated by the 2-atom displacement, the estimate for each of the 3-atom and 4-atom displacements is poor unless the temperature is very low.

The ridges between the, similar, concerted motion \sap{1}s are shown in \fref{fig:low-barriers}.
It can be clearly seen applying HTST to the concerted 3 and 4 atom \sap{1}s is highly questionable as their neighbouring \sap{2}s are very low, $\mytilde 0.005\unit{eV}$ and $0.012\unit{eV}$, certainly lower than the $5\kB T$ rule of thumb\footnote{at any temperature above $9\unit{K}$ and $28\unit{K}$ respectively.}.
However, applying HTST to the concerted 2 atom mechanism is more justified, by visual inspection the ridge is fairly near harmonicity up to the $5\kB T = 0.128\unit{eV}$ limit at room temperature and the \sap{2}s are still higher.
\Fref{fig:integral-ratios} further shows that the concerted 2 atom rate has a correction factor, $\Gamma$, of approximately $1.0$ throughout the temperature range while the concerted 3 and 4 atom mechanisms have significant correction factors at all temperatures.

It might appear wise to rigorously calculate such a correction factor for all the degrees of freedom until one considers the complexity of such an exercise.
Figure 6 in paper \ref{pap:second-order} makes an effort to put into context the abundance of ridges on which each \sap{1} lies but, of course, fails to do so properly due to the immense dimensionality (771 degrees of freedom) of the PES.
Not only finding all the \sap{1}s leading out of a given basin but also finding all neighbouring \sap{2}s and ridges for each one would be folly due to the sheer amount of possible \sap{}s.
Furthermore, as stated when introducing the correction factor, $\Gamma$ is not a rigorous correction factor and should not be used as such.
However, using the ridge to calculate a more precise reaction rate, outside the HTST framework, seems appropriate and will make an interesting subject for future research.

\subsubsection{Performance}
Theoretically, ridge calculations should scale like the NEB effort times the Dimer effort, i.c. 3 times the NEB effort.
However, directly comparing the determination of MEPs to the determination of ridges is unfair, \expand
