%\item The Dimer has been used succesfully on the system
%&\item The system is easy to calculate (EAM)
\item Good real world example to test the ridge method on (Both similar and dis-similar events present) at a reasonable computational cost.
\item Corner-Cutting?

This system was chosen as a test case for the ridge method \expand
The dimer method, on which the current implementation of ridge calculations heavily depends, has been used succesfully on the system~\cite{dimer-original1999}, using the well tuned and fast embedded atom method (\fref{sec:potentials})~\cite{eam-1983, eam-1986}.
