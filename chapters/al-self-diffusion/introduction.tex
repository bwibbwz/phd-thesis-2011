An Al adatom on the Al(100) surface provides an interesting system to study because several different diffusion mechanisms have been found, including various concerted displacements of two or more atoms, in addition to the, more intuitive, hop mechanism~\cite{concerted-motion-1990, dimer-original-1999, ts-opt-2001}.

This system was chosen as a test case for the ridge method \expand
The dimer method, on which the current implementation of ridge calculations heavily depends, has been used succesfully on the system~\cite{dimer-original1999}, using the well tuned and fast embedded atom method (\fref{sec:potentials})~\cite{eam-1983, eam-1986}.
