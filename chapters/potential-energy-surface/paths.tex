Steepest Descent Paths (SDPs) are paths on a multidimensional function, $f$, for which there is no perpendicular gradient component,
\beq{sdp-definition}
\nabla \vect{f} - (\nabla \vect{f} \cdot \uvt)\uvt = \vect{0},
\eeq
where $\uvt$ is the tangent to the path.
They can be created by following the negative gradient until it vanishes.
SDPs can begin anywhere, apart from points with a vanishing gradient, but, generally, end at minima (most common) or \sap{}s.
Two sorts of SDPs are of particular interest for the work presented in this thesis, both of which are discussed below.

\subsubsection{Minimum Energy Paths}
The Minimum Energy Path (MEP) is a collection of two specific SDPs, used in the context of theoretical reaction chemistry and represents a likely reaction path on the PES.
It connects two neighbouring minima through a \sap{1} (and through any intermediate \sap{1}s with a lowest Hessian eigenvalue of zero), where each SDP begins~\cite{neb-polemic-henkelman1}, with an infinitesimal displacement along the path.

\subsubsection{Ridges}
Similar to MEPs, ridges are collections of specific SDPs, but with their starting points at \sap{2}s and their end points in \sap{1}s.
Of course, MEPs do not exist near \sap{2}s, and the analogue ends there as the criterion for a ridge demands a negative eigenvalue in the reduced Hessian, perpendicular to the path.
