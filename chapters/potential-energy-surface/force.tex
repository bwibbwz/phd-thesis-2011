\section{Force}
\label{sec:force}
Since the PES, $E(\vR)$, is, generally, not known \textit{a priori}, traversing it is difficult without a guide.
Such a guide exists in the form of the gradient, $\nabla E(\vR)$, in which information about the increase/decrease of the function (here: PES) is encoded.
The gradient points towards the direction of greatest increase, however, in atomic simulations such areas are, commonly, of little interest.
Most of the time, systems are at, or near, stable structures, which are represented by minima on the PES.
Defining a force that, similarly to real world forces, points the system towards areas of lowest potential energy, is straight forwards as the negative gradient,
\beq{force-general}
\vF(\vR) = -\nabla E(\vR).
\eeq

The gradient is not directly available from DFT calculations, as for other non-analytical PESes.
Fortunatelly, for variational calculations, such as DFT, a force theorem has been developed, stating that $\partial E / \partial\lamda$ can be evaluated for for a continous parameter $\lambda$ on which the wavefunction, $\Psi(\lambda)$, depends implictily,
\beq{hellmann-feynman-forces-full}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial \lambda} = 
\bra \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \lambda} | \widehat{H} | \Psi \ket +
\bra \Psi | \frac{\partial \widehat{H}}{\partial \lambda} | \Psi \ket +
\bra \Psi | \widehat{H} | \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \lambda} \ket.
\eeq
Utilizing the orthogoanlity of the wave function, the first and last terms are zero, 
\beq{hellmann-feynman-forces-final}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial \lambda} = \bra \Psi | \frac{\partial \widehat{H}}{\partial \lambda} | \Psi \ket.
\eeq
Once the electronic wave function has been constructed, which is the most time consuming part, the gradient can be calculated.
For DFT, and any other Born-Oppenheimer calculation, $\lambda$ can be the nuclear coordinates.
%\beq{dft-nuclear-forces}
%\vF_\lambda = \frac{\partial E}{\partial \vR_\lambda} = \bra \Psi | \frac{\partial \widehat{H}}{\partial \vR_\lambda} | \Psi \ket = 
%\eeq

The theorem has been proved independantly by multiple authors~\cite{forces-pauli-1933, forces-guttinger-1932} but is generally attributed to Richard Feynman\cite{forces-feynman-1939} and Hans Hellmann~\cite{forces-hellmann-1937}, as the Hellmann-Feynmann Theorem.
