Reaction rates in theoretical chemistry was the main focus of this thesis.
Applying current methods to aid analysis of experimental data in complex borohydrides and improving these commonly used methods.

Complex borohydrides are materials of high hydrogen storage capacity and too high thermodynamic stability.
Understanding the high stability is of great importance to the development of suitable materials for hydrogen storage.
In an effort to gain insight into the structural transitions of two such materials, \ce{Ca(BH4)2} and \ce{Mg(BH4)2}, low temperature rotational dynamics experiments were performed.
The work presented in here revolved around assisting in the data analysis by performing density functional theory calculations on the possible dynamical events.
For the \ce{Mg(BH4)2}, only rotational dynamics were detected and they were in good agreement with the experimental values, showing that $C_2$-type rotations happen at lower temperatures than $C_3$-type rotations and that approximately $15\%$ of the \ce{BH4} units activate at a lower temperature than the rest.
For the \ce{Ca(BH4)2}, in addition to the rotational dynamics, longer range diffusion was detected.
Most likely this was due to \ce{H2}-interstitial defects.
The rotational dynamics were more prominent in the data and good agreement with the experiments was reached, showing that $C_3$-type rotations activate at lower temperatures than $C_2$-type rotations.
